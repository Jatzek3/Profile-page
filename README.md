# Profile page Aplication

The name speaks for itself. It may not look like much but it's an Iceberg.
Aplication created as an recruitment task.
During development of the project my main sources of knowledge and inspiration were:

1. A practical guide to Redux Form - ERIK RASMUSSEN 
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey7H8h4ERHg
2. Build a React + Redux App with TypeScript and Redux Form 
         https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-js-typescript-redux-redux-form-jest-e522995ebe36
3. Redux Forms Documentation
         https://redux-form.com/8.3.0/
4. Client-side image upload in React
